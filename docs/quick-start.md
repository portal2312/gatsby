title: Quick Start
---

This quick start is intended for intermediate to advanced developers. For a gentler intro to Gatsby, [head to our tutorial](/docs/tutorial/getting-started/)!

## Getting started with Gatsby

1.  Create a new site:

    ```shell
    npm init gatsby
    ```

2.  Once everything is downloaded you will see a message with instructions for navigating to your site and running it locally.

    ```shell
    cd my-gatsby-site
    ```

    Start the local development server:

    ```shell
    npm run develop
    ```

    Gatsby will start a hot-reloading development environment accessible by default at `http://localhost:8000`.

3.  Now you're ready to make changes to your site!

    Try editing the home page in `src/pages/index.js`. Saved changes will live reload in the browser.
